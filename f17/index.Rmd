title: "Parallel Data Processing in MapReduce F'17"
---


Big data is a catchall term for datasets that are resource intensive. This course will introduce student to parallel and distributed processing technologies for analyzing 'big data'.  The course will cover programming paradigms and abstractions for data analysis at scale. Students will gain an understanding of the performance and usability trade-offs of various technologies and paradigms. Students will become familiar with technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, H20 and TensorFlow amongst other. Hands-on assignments will focus on machine learning and data analysis tasks.  The class builds on known principles such as the design recipe, testing and code reviews.

## prereqs

Students should have taken the Algorithms course, should enjoy programming and strive to write beautiful code.

## staff

__Instructors:__ _Jan Vitek_ and _Konrad Siek_
__Teaching Assistant:__ _Aviral Goel_

Communication with staff is __exclusively__ through [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/j793b4islbv6nu). Use private notes for messages that should not be visible to other students.

## work

Approximatively fifteen hours a week, with regular codewalks and in-class tests.

## grading

The class grade is on 100 points with 33 points for in-class participation (quizzes, questions, paper presentation, note taking), 34 points for the final project (software, report and oral defense) and 33 points for codewalks. The final grade is given on a scale of A=90, A-=85, B+=80, B=75, B-=70, C=65, D=55.  Codewalks conducted in class focus on the student's code output and graded based on code quality.

## authorship

Every code element (file or function) __must__ have a note ascribing authorship to an initial author and, possibly,  multiple maintainers. Sharing code is allowed. Changing authorship is cheating. 

## integrity

Cheating means an F to __all__ involved parties, expulsion from the class and notification of ORAF.

## presence

There will be few traditional lectures, instead we discuss code, books and papers. Student will answer questions about assigned reading during class. Students should notify the instructor of absences. A scribe will record discussions in a shared document.

## hours

Reception hours are held daily M,W,R from 11 am to 12 am. Class is in the 
__Forsyth Building__, room 129, Tuesday, Friday 3:30 -- 5:00.

## regrades

All regrade requests and grade challenges __must__ be submitted in writing, private posts on Piazza, no more than __7 days__ after the grade was awarded.  

## codewalks

A _code review_ is conducted after each task. Teams review other teams' work, commenting on code quality, design, documentation and tests. The goal is to produce actionable suggestions for improvements. The output of a review is a report. _Code walks_ are in-class discussions of programming tasks that start from a code review and explore the implementation of a student's project. Review are emailed in PDF to the instructor and code authors. They comment on the report, code and packaging. The report should give sufficient information to understand what was achieved. It should be clear and complete. The code should be well documents, avoid repetition, have no obvious bugs, have authorship comments. The packaging should make the results easily reproducible.  Be curious about the code. Question the results. Don't waste space in your report on what works well -- spend your time on what could be improved. Avoid generalities, be precise, give examples.
