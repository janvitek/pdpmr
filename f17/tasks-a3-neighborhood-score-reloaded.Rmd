```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an opportunity to revisit your implementation and report for A2. 

The only new requirements for this week are:
  * *also* the performance on AWS running on 2 and 4 nodes.
  * return the *median* rather than the mean score of each word's k-neighborhoods.

Everything else is unchanged. Include in your report a description of the changes that you had to make to your  code to support returning the median.
