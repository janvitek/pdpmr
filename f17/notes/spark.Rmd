# Overview

* Framework for distributed computation
* Based on the concept of RDDs
* May use Hadoop as a back-end
* Faster than Hadoop due to in-memory storage
  
# RDDs

*Resilient Data Structures* (RDDs)

Pipeline programming

Lazy and immutable:

* Original structure unchanged, changes logged
* Cache-able

## Creating RDDs

parallelize,
read from file

## Transformations

```scala
map
flatMap
filter
distinct
```

## Actions

## Architecture

Distributing RDDs
Serializing

## Caching

# Iterativity

# Latency

## RDD cacheing
